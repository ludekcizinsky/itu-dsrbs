## About
The main focus of this course was on `qualitative experiments`, i.e., how to
collect qualitative data and how to process them in an academic way. In this
repository, you can find the mandatory course work, here is a quick overview:


- [data journals](coursework/data_journal): there was in total 10 data journals
  with the aim to do the work needed for the final report, here I only provide
  those which required individual writing

- [final report](coursework/report): this is my final submission for the course,
  in appendix you can find many details which were required as part of other
  data journals

In case of any questions, please let me know at luci@itu.dk.
